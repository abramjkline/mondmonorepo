# Philosophy of the Night

Philosophical pondering<br>
Who are we, why are we here?<br>
Where is here and what are we?<br>
Why do we doubt and praise and fear?<br>
Are we in the simulation?<br>
Is this a fabricated view?<br>
And do I really give a shit,<br>
What frame I’m looking through?<br>
If I care then why?<br>
So I can commandeer my fate?<br>
So I can feel some bit of power?<br>
So reality and I can have a date?<br>
It’s an interesting time,<br>
Taking a walk around your mind,<br>
The folds and bends inside your head,<br>
They wind and turn you back in time,<br>
And to the future whatever that means,<br>
When time is but a memory,<br>
It’s warped and maybe spiraling,<br>
Behind, ahead, just out of reach,<br>
Suppress these thoughts,<br>
Succumb to being in the dark,<br>
Blissfully unaware or not,<br>
It’s all just dogs without a bark,<br>
We can grasp onto some belief,<br>
And hold it fiercely in the deep,<br>
Then it is real, we made it be,<br>
Even if there is no we,<br>
Even if there is no proof,<br>
No evidential smoking gun,<br>
I know these thoughts are real,<br>
I know I’m thinking and it’s fun,<br>
Now two things are true for me,<br>
At a very bare minimum,<br>
I’m sure there are more to see,<br>
Somewhere inside of my cerebrum.<br>
