# November 12

It was a warm autumn afternoon,<br>
She didn’t have the slightest clue of what I would soon do to make it all true.<br>
I caught her by surprise,<br>
The tears from her eyes streamed down her cheeks; she could hardly speak.<br>

I used to think it was funny how a ring could stand for everything,<br>
How a little sparkle, a little gleam, could ever change anything.<br>
I thought it was about money, exploiting love in the name of greed,<br>
But the look on her face explained everything.<br>

Our big day will come,<br>
God willing with sun, to shine from the clouds as we say our vows.<br>
We’ll dance our first dance and start a life of romance,<br>
With just one phrase that we’ll take to our graves.<br>

My hands they were shaking,<br>
But the chance was worth taking,<br>
Cause I knew I’d found the one,<br>
With a heart made of gold,<br>
I know we’ll grow old,<br>
And ride off into the sun,<br>
A circle and a stone,<br>
A sign you’ll never be alone,<br>
As long as I’m alive,<br>
I’ll be by your side.<br>
