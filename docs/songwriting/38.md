What's is all for?
Spinning our wheels,
Chasing down some shadow, 
Of what we thought was real.
Take a step back,
Assess what's at the core,
Trim off all the fat, 
You'll end up with more.

Let it all go,
The shape of what you know,
Crumbles to the floor,
When you release your ego,
Time it flies by,
And the memories fade away,
But the ones that made your mold, 
Feels just like yesterday.

When it boils down,
The greatest moments in life, 
Are sights and sounds,
I can see it know,
Emotion rushes in and my heart pounds,
It's pretty profound,
That an image in my mind can heal me when I'm feeling down,
I've finally come around,
To letting go and holding on to all the moments I just can't live without.

Time is only ours,
If we take it and run at the stars,
It's a single shot, and I'm not missing out on this one.
