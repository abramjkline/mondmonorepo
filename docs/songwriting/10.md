We’ve been running around this town for awhile now,<br>
At times I think I forgot how it feels,<br>
To be humming tunes for you in my free time,<br>
I think I wanna kick those wheels.<br>
<br>
Life’s been coming at us at a breakneck speed,<br>
Barely lets us dust off our clothes,<br>
It’s been a fine forest full of bittersweet,<br>
Thinks it’s time we harvest ourselves a sweet old grove.<br>
<br>
I see a rolling countryside shining in my mind,<br>
Sweet breeze pushing right past your hair,<br>
A foggy cup of coffee is by your side,<br>
We could go get lost if we could just get there.<br>
<br>
If all I leave behind is these old love songs,<br>
I think I’m pretty okay with that,<br>
Our story has unraveled across these six strings,<br>
One day our grandkids just might play it back.<br>
