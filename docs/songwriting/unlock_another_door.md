# Unlock Another Door

Some days it seems like everywhere you turn another devil’s trying to bring you down,<br>
And the towers you’ve been building to the heavens have fallen down,<br>
But I’ve heard that when life slams another door in your face,<br>
It also plants a key in your pocket that unlocks another one someplace.<br>

So let them tear your towers down,<br>
They don’t define you anyway.<br>
You’ll find peace in the sound.<br>
Unlock another door today.<br>

My life’s no game day cliché pitting me against my rival, no.<br>
It’s about find purpose in my plan, beyond survival.<br>
But if you just take a second and step back, the big picture’s so clear,<br>
It’s amazing how taking perspective can melt away all your fears.<br>

You’ve got to keep your eyes wide open,<br>
And realize that sometimes defeat is only opportunity in disguise.<br>
