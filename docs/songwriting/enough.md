# Enough

Your heart’s so big it pulled me in,<br>
You’ve got so much love, where do I begin?<br>
Every morning, you say “Good morning, sunshine.”<br>
Puts a smile on my face every time.<br>

Cause we’ve got it so good,<br>
Like all true lovers should,<br>
We don’t have to worry about much,<br>
Cause we’ve got each other,<br>
And that’s enough.<br>

You’re my number one fan, supporting the band,<br>
You come to every single show you can,<br>
You’re making me pancakes after those late nights when my lazy head is sleeping in,<br>
Drinking some coffee over a crossword,<br>
It’s the simple things that make me breathe,<br>
I plan on making this a habit for further out that I can see.<br>

Sure we’ll argue from time to time,<br>
So I’ve heard, true love doesn’t walk a straight line,<br>
Yea we’ll have our ups and downs,<br>
But I hope you find comfort in knowing that I’m always gonna be around.<br>
