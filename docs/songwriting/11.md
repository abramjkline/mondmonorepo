# 11

Eleven years of you and me, living in married bliss,<br>
Sure 10 gets all the sun with its fanfare and fun,<br>
But with 10+1 there’s something that people miss,<br>
The steadfast dedication in the shadow of an epic vacation isn’t easy for sure,<br>
Showing up every day, in a lovingly way,<br>
Knowing full well there’ll be no Italian shore,<br>
It’s easy when waking to breathtaking landscaping of gently rolling hills,<br>
And much harder it seems living suburbian dreams,<br>
Surviving on memories and stills,<br>
Eleven is there with its grace and its care, aware it'll be bare an extravagant trip,<br>
But it’s here nonetheless, it doesn’t need any press,<br>
Proving that true love isn’t a blip,<br>
Adventure-seeking or not, it honestly doesn’t matter one bit,<br>
Whether darling or din, whatever world that I’m in,<br>
It’s always the best when you’re in it.<br>
