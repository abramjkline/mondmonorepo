# Lullaby

Well I wrote this song for you,<br>
To help you make it through the night,<br>
To drift off into your mind,<br>
When I can’t be by your side,<br>
Holding you tight,<br>
All through the night,<br>
I hope this keeps you company.<br>

This is your lullaby.<br>

If I was there I’d be your blanket,<br>
I’d thank the sweet lord for answering my prayers,<br>
And giving me a woman like you,<br>
To hold in my arms and give my love to,<br>
And that’s just what you do.<br>

This is your lullaby.<br>

Well it’s cold when you’re all alone,<br>
It don’t matter the temperature,<br>
I’ll chase away those chills,<br>
I’ll be your comforter.<br>

So close your eyes,<br>
I hope you find peace up in your mind,<br>
Let the music pull you in,<br>
Let my words be your medicine,<br>
And drift away until the sun brings in another day.<br>

This is your lullaby.<br>
