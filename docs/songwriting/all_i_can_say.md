# All I Can Say

Well I don’t know,<br>
Where this life might take me,<br>
But I can hope,<br>
It takes me somewhere beautiful.<br>

I always ask why,<br>
Things are the way they are,<br>
But I’ve got to rely,<br>
That it’s been written in the stars.<br>

All I can say is make way,<br>
Cause I’ve got plans today,<br>
And I’m gonna get em done.<br>

Well I can’t see what this life might hold for me,<br>
But I’ll try to be the best man I can be.<br>
