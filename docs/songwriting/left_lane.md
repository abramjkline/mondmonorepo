# Left Lane

Some say that distance makes the heart grow fonder,<br>
As long as you don’t let your mind get lost and wander.<br>
Well, I guess that I might be the case,<br>
But I’d still rather be sitting here staring at your pretty face.<br>

We’ve got a lot of highway lying in between us,<br>
Ain’t no reason to let it get in our way,<br>
No distance could erase our fate,<br>
I’ll be wearing down a path driving northbound in the left hand lane.<br>

We should take our time take it slow,<br>
But I really want you to know,<br>
You’re the only woman on my mind and I think you’re gonna find I’ll be driving up the road.<br>
I don’t want to lose you,<br>
And I think we’re onto something here,<br>
These Carolina skies are crying,<br>
And girl I wish you were here.<br>

Now it seems to be we’re prisoners to proximity,<br>
Bound by these chains of a city and a street name,<br>
But I plan on busting out and breaking free,<br>
I’ll be riding 95 in the left lane, there’s a pretty lady that I’ve gotta see.<br>

I think it’s pretty plain to see,<br>
I’ve been thinking about you constantly,<br>
Can’t hardly wait to see you,<br>
And it’ll be another couple weeks,<br>
I’ll be driving north and you’ll be coming south,<br>
You know where we’ll meet,<br>
For dinner and a sunrise,<br>
In the skies over DC.<br>
