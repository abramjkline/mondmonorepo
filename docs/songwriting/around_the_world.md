# Around the World

The night it creeps,<br>
It sneaks up on us like a thief,<br>
Next thing we’re asleep.<br>
Sunrise it screams,<br>
It wakes us from a sound sleep,<br>
We find our feet.<br>

But we’re no slaves to this life,<br>
We can do with it what we like,<br>
We can grasp each moment before it goes,<br>
And if we don’t we’ll never know.<br>

I’ve been around the world ten times in my mind,<br>
I’ve seen the seven oceans shine,<br>
I’ve climbed the peaks in Nepal and Japan,<br>
I’ve walked across the desert sands.<br>

This life it seems,<br>
We get so caught up planning everything,<br>
That we lose our dreams,<br>
This life we live,<br>
It begs for us to take in all it gives,<br>
There’s so many gifts.<br>

But we’re no slaves to this life,<br>
We can do with it what we like,<br>
We can grasp each moment before it goes,<br>
And if we don’t we’ll never know.<br>

I’ll be around the world ten times before I die,<br>
I’ll see the seven the oceans shine and they’ll shine so bright,<br>
And you can bet on my life that when I die,<br>
You’ll bury me with a smile.<br>
I’ll be around the world ten times.<br>
You’ll bury me with a smile.<br>
