# Candle

Life gets so fast sometimes,<br>
it's a little hard to handle,<br>
But I've been so blessed,<br>
that nothing else could light a candle to what I've got,<br>
It's why I'm here today,<br>
It's why I came to say, "I Do",<br>

Though life may be hard sometimes,<br>
I know that, with you by my side,<br>
We'll make it through the darkest nights,<br>
We'll always see it through,<br>

Because baby you're my candle in the dark,<br>
You give me strength to handle the weight of the world,<br>
Together we will wrangle in the stars,<br>
To light up our whole life when times are hard.<br>

Our family's all in town,<br>
And our friends have gathered round to celebrate,<br>
You're beautiful in white on a beautiful night,<br>
What more could I say?<br>

Though life may be hard sometimes,<br>
I know that, with you by my side,<br>
We'll make it through the darkest nights,<br>
We'll always see it through,<br>

Because baby you're my candle in the dark,<br>
You give me strength to handle the weight of the world,<br>
Together we will wrangle in the stars,<br>
To light up our whole life when times are hard.<br>

Because baby you're my candle in the dark,<br>
You give me strength to handle the weight of the world,<br>
Together we will wrangle in the stars,<br>
To light up our whole life when times are hard.<br>

And when it's time for the last call,<br>
You know I'm down for the long haul home with you.<br>
