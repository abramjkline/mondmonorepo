# Where You've Been

Life is full of lessons,<br>
You better count your blessings twice,<br>
Because you’ve only got one life,<br>
Life is like a highway,<br>
Cutting through the heartland,<br>
You can chase that horizon, but when it comes there’ll only be another one.<br>

I don’t pretend to know what’s next,<br>
But I live my life with no regrets,<br>
Every time I trip and fall I find out who I am,<br>
It’s not knowing where you’re going,<br>
But where you’ve been.<br>

Everyone wants to know the secret to finding happiness in their lives,<br>
Well, you don’t need to crack a safe for you to realize,<br>
It was with you all along,<br>
You had it this whole time,<br>
Don’t you know man, it’s what you’ve got inside.<br>

I don’t pretend to know what’s next,<br>
But I live my life with no regrets.<br>
Every stone along the road has made me who I am,<br>
It’s not knowing where you’re going,<br>
But where you’ve been.<br>

I don’t pretend to know what’s next,<br>
But I live my life with no regrets,<br>
Every time I hit a wall I’m less a child and more a man,<br>
It’s not know where you’re going,<br>
But where you’ve been.<br>
