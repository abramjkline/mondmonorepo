# Welcome Home

Bullet shells and beer cans on the floor of your trembling hooch,<br>
Fear and desperation, sweat and heat, hinges coming loose,<br>
A lock on your refrigerator, social norms of no more use,<br>
Army green chuck taylors, best intentions in these shoes.<br>

A hustle in the jungle, why not try to make a buck?<br>
Nickel to drown your sorrows while youâ€™re down here on your luck,<br>
Letters from your father, more depth than you knew was there,<br>
Perhaps he'd pushed you far enough, to finally show you that he cared.<br>

We found the bottom of that rye and lightning took its place,<br>
Memories came pouring out, seldom shown to the light of day,<br>
Wisdom from that armchair, I'm just glad that I was there,<br>
Regrets, redemption, lessons learned, a perspective unimpaired.<br>

Saturation for the duration, the whole damn thing right up in smoke,<br>
Touchdown garden state, wasted, in the trash, not a single welcome home,<br>
Stumbled upon an open ear in an unlikely candidate,<br>
He was too soon taken, self-inflicted, Boston held his fate.<br>

Took a trip out west to see your brother in Idaho,<br>
Unsaid recollections reserved for only those who truly know, <br>
I can only imagine this true for all the sights you'd seen,<br>
You travel light, but always pay the baggage fee.<br>

Some things die too hard and sometimes not at all,<br>
Some memories go too fast, some never see the curtain fall,<br>
Some are minuscule in scope, some are stories tall,<br>
Relay your lessons to those you love before the sirens start to call.<br>
