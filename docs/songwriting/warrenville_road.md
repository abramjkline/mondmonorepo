# Warrenville Road

It was a rainy summer night on Warrenville Road,<br>
Driving in from Long Island when we lost control,<br>
We spent a couple hours with the Greenbrook Police Patrol,<br>
That silver beauty hit a pole, god rest her soul.<br>

It could’ve been a lot worse, god forbid somebody died,<br>
When you get thrown off in this life, you’ve got to get back on and ride,<br>
The show must go on; we’ll keep on down the line,<br>
You can’t derail this train; we’ll ride right through the night.<br>

It’s summer nights like these that make you lose your mind,<br>
You can’t quite figure out how you made it out alive,<br>
But we’ll pull it together; you know we’ll be just fine,<br>
It’s summer nights like these I thank god I’m alive.<br>

We’ve been all the way to Florida and right back up the east coast,<br>
Seen a lot of highway; a bit more than most,<br>
To this summer I say, “Raise a glass”, and make a toast,<br>
Cause we’ve been living life and, man, the lord knows.<br>
