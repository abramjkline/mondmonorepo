# Cold Season

The cold winds blowing in,<br>
Autumn leaves are falling,<br>
Long sleeves they’re calling,<br>
To warm our skin.<br>
The night air smells of burning,<br>
The furnace is fired up,<br>
The houses they’re all shut,<br>
To keep the warm in.<br>

Dylan's in the blankets,<br>
And Hooch is at our feet,<br>
The house breathes deep,<br>
The kids, they’re fast asleep.<br>
Pumpkins lit with candles,<br>
And children draped in sheets,<br>
It’s your favorite season,<br>
And you’re my favorite treat.<br>

The cold season blows in,<br>
But it’s alright by me,<br>
Cause I found another reason,<br>
To pull you in close to me,<br>
We’ll curl up by the fire,<br>
And sip wine by candle light,<br>
I found another reason,<br>
Why the cold season, it’s all right.<br>

October, November, December,<br>
Each day that goes by and the more I remember,<br>
You’re the reason for my seasons,<br>
And no matter the weather, you’ll always make it better.<br>
