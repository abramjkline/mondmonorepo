What's is all for?<br>
Spinning our wheels,<br>
Chasing down some shadow,<br>
Of what we thought was real.<br>
Take a step back,<br>
Assess what's at the core,<br>
Trim off all the fat,<br>
You'll end up with more.<br>

Let it all go,<br>
The shape of what you know,<br>
Crumbles to the floor,<br>
When you release your ego,<br>
Time it flies by,<br>
And the memories fade away,<br>
But the ones that made your mold,<br>
Feels just like yesterday.<br>

When it boils down,<br>
The greatest moments in life,<br>
Are sights and sounds,<br>
I can see it know,<br>
Emotion rushes in and my heart pounds,<br>
It's pretty profound,<br>
That an image in my mind can heal me when I'm feeling down,<br>
I've finally come around,<br>
To letting go and holding on to all the moments I just can't live without.<br>

Time is only ours,<br>
If we take it and run at the stars,<br>
It's a single shot, and I'm not missing out on this one.<br>
