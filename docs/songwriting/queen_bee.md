# Queen Bee

Music is my mistress and that’s how it’ll always be,<br>
But you’ll never find me cheating or lacking loyalty,<br>
Cause I’ll always love you woman,<br>
And I’ll always treat you kind,<br>
But music is my mistress,<br>
Cause she’s always on my mind.<br>

I’ll be humming in the morning,<br>
And strumming every chance I get,<br>
I’ll write lots of love songs about you,<br>
So many that you’ll never forget,<br>
Just how much I love you and how much you mean to me,<br>
See music is my mistress,<br>
But you’ll always be my queen bee.<br>

There will never come a day that I’ll ever say, “I don’t want to play.”<br>
Cause there’s something in my soul that makes me feel whole every time I unlock that case,<br>
The way you make me feel makes it all real when I put a pencil to a page,<br>
You bring the music out of me and you’re so honey sweet, and you’ll always be my queen bee.<br>

Music is my mistress but she’s not your enemy,<br>
She’s kind and warm, and true to form,<br>
And always good company,<br>
She’ll keep me out late from time to time,<br>
But she’ll never cross the line,<br>
Music is my mistress, but you’ll always be queen of the hive.<br>
