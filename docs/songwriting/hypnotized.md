# Hypnotized

Fire-filled skies fade fast behind me as I plunge into the night,<br>
And I know these flames will find my eyes again once I reach the other side,<br>
Dimly lit orbs fly past in pairs to my left,<br>
Embers lag behind and chase a dying sunset.<br>
Black sheets roll beneath my feet and spinning steel,<br>
Hurling me home where the passion is real.<br>

Pedal to the floor and you know I’m on my way,<br>
An early twilight arrival, true love at day break,<br>
I fall into my niche,<br>
I drown in brown eyes,<br>
Never again a need to use our goodbyes.<br>

Somehow an angel has fallen in this bed,<br>
Finagled her halo from off of her head,<br>
She lays by my side with her eyes open wide,<br>
There’s a gate in the sky god left open wide.<br>
There’s fire in the skies,<br>
There’s fire in my mind,<br>
There’s fire in the night,<br>
The fire in your eyes has got me hypnotized.<br>
